 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 
 GREASE_WAR_NAME:0 "The Grease And Centauran Wars"
 GREASE_WAR_DESC:0 "It's the dawn of a new century, and it might be the bloodiest of them all. Worsening relations between Orion and Ursa may ignite a war at any moment while Hydrus, the newly independent country of Forma, seeks to claim the former territories of the Ursan Federation. Over at Centaura, 20 years after the invasion of South Corvus, Corvus prepares to retake their former territory while Antares prepares on an unification, unseen since the days of the Libran Empire."
 ANT_1900_DESC:0 "The Antares Imperium was established as an union between Skorpius, Ara, Norma and Lupus in the  1600's, and has been a powerhouse of southern Centaura ever since. With one of the largest armed forces and industry in the world, Antares under Kalvin Tau's leadership is preparing for something. And it is something great..."
 ORI_1900_DESC:0 "The Orion Republic is the largest and arguably most powerfull nation in the world. It's industrial might is unrivaled and across it's vast territory there are boundless resources. However, the rural areas are underdeveloped, there is rampant corruption and massive differences between the rich and the poor. Meanwhile the republic is preparing for a war to finally end Ursan colonialism on the continent and free the people of Canis and Lepus."
 CET_1900_DESC:0 "Cetus is the predominant naval power of the world and is in a confortable position; it has a relatively industrialized economy, large amounts of resources and something. However, it's isolationist policy has led to worsening relations with it's neighbours, and the prioritozation of the navy over the army has left it vulnerable to land invasions."
 COV_1900_DESC:0 "It has been 20 years since the Cetan invasion of South Corvus, and the Corvuns are reeling from the loss of their resource-rich and developed southern territories. The revanchist Corvun government and its patriotic population is ready to do anything to retake their lost territories, or die trying."
 URS_1900_DESC:0 "The Federation of Ursa is an empire of northern Forma which is in decline. Internal protests, the ever more rebellious Hydran colonies and the threat of Orion and the recently independent Hydrus shows that the 20th century will be harsh for the Federation of Ursa."
 HYS_1900_DESC:0 "Hydrus is the most recnt nation of Forma, previously being a colony of Ursa. The momentum of colonial revolts across the Ursan empire gained from Hydrus' independence makes it clear that Ursa's domination will soon end, and Hydrus stands to gain. Who knows what this new nation will accomplish in this new century."
 RIA_1900_DESC:0 "The northern giant that is the Republic of Riaa is the first republic on Centaura after it's monarchy was overthrown in the latter 1800's with the dynasty retreating to the western islands of Vulpa. Although it has a massive population and military, it is a poor nation ruled by the total controll of the nationalist party which ever since the revolution has reformed and modernized Riaa. Whatever the future brings, the ever strengthening Riaa will play an important part in it."
 LBR_1900_DESC:0 "The Federation of Libra is the remnant of the ancient Libran Empire which at it's height controlled the whole world. Ever since the empire withered away and retreated back to it's home islands in year 0, Libra has been an extremely isolationist country with it's later emperors building massive fortifications on the larger islands to protect the nation from the barbarians of the rest of the world. The influence of the once great Libran Empire is still felt in the world with most of the world speaking Libran (english). It's prestige as the legitimate decendant of the Empire has made it an international mediator and ever since the end of it's isolationism it has been the host of many multinational conferences and organizations. The Federation of Libra is what some consider a remnant of the past, and others consider a bastion and continuation of ancient civilization and culture.  "

 FORMAN_WAR_NAME:0 "The Forman War"
 FORMAN_WAR_DESC:0 "In the aftermath of the bloody Centauran Wars, Antares has finally taken over the continent. The armies of Antares and Ursa are advancing upon the last bastion, the Hydran continent. Ursa laments the loss of Canis to Hydrus, and tensions between Orion and Antares are worsening. As both worlds collide, a war of unthinkable magnitude will soon consume Forma, and the fate of who wins this war will undoubtedly decide the course of the next centuries."
 ANT_1944_DESC:0 "After over 30 years of war, Antares has conquered Centaura and has the biggest army and navy in the world. But everything is not as good as it seems. Decades of war has exhausted the homefront, massive territories needs to be garrisoned and integrated. But Antares can not relax, for it has another massive war to prepare for; a war, greater than the Centauran war, to conquer ALL  OF  FORMA."
 ORI_1944_desc:0 "Having stood idily by while watching Antares consume a continent, the Orion Republic has maintained it's position as the largest economic power in the world, and is ready to defend itself against any Antarean Invasion and is ready and willing to do so."
