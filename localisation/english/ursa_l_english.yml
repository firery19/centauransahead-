URS_preGreaseWars_Decisions_desc:0 "It is not a secret that our influence in Hydra have been slowly decaying over the past few decades. Our federation was humiliated when we were forced to withdrawl from Hydrus in 1899. It is our duty to show the world that we are still the strong proud nation we were destined to be.\n\nEvery month, we will receive reports of damages down by terrorists in Lepus and Canis. These can range from loss of equipment or manpower and damage to infrastructure or factories. The severity of these negative effects can be §Yreduced by expending command power£GFX_command_power §!. However, allowing terrorists to get away too often may give them the confidence to stage an open rebellion!"

Orion and Hydrus has taken oppourtunity of this, but we must make sure they wont any longer."

In the past few decades, the Ursan Federation has been slowly losing its grip on its colonial possessions. Following the withdrawl from Hydrus, the Ursan government has increased intolerance towards dissent which has led to worse quality of life on Canis and Lepus. This has all come to ahead with Eastern Lepus rising up with thousands of partisans securing the important cities and infrastructure. Intelligence reports say that the situation in Lepus is untenable and Ursan troops will be forced to withdrawl entirely. A war is looming. We will not accept a second humiliation against insurgents; however, Orion and Hydrus have been waiting for a moment to strike our empire and finish off our empire for good!

Supplies reaching our troops in western Lepus are repeatedly intercepted by rebels within eastern Canis and overseas in the Hydrusite channel. Intelligence in Orion and Hydrus have warned us of the two supporting another open rebellion in eastern Canis.
